Thank you for your visit my website.
I am a software engineer and usually work at an company. After work, I also create some games, services and OSS.

I have been posting articles about technology and so on. If you are interested my posts, [please visit it](../posts).(I'm sorry but I write in Japanese) 

## Experience
Programming language is tool, so I don't have likes and dislikes in programming languages. They should be used suitable on any cases. 

* Languages (in business)
  * C# (Unity)
  * Go
  * C++
  * Perl
